# We are going to extract annual average rainfall in Tanzania 
# for all years (that we have data for) of Tanzania 
# We are using a raster data that covers Tanzania and more and has monthly data 

# Later on we will use these data to see if variation in rainfall predicts
# variation in maize yield.

# where is the monthly precipitation data ?

# we have 408 layers
s

# let's plot a few
plot(s)
# (by default, only the first 16 are plotted)

# the first three
plot(s, 1:3)


# let's look at the mean for each month
# we use the tapp function. We tell it to make 12 layers (by combining the 1st, with the 13th, 25th, etc. layer --- recycling at work).
rainmonth <- tapp(s, 1:12, mean)
# set the right names

# we want to compare annual maize yield with annual rainfall. 
# the Tanzania dry season is in the middle of the year
# it may be better to have "rain-years" that start in July and run through June

# we make explicit indices to group months
# 34 years, 12 months
i <- rep(1:34, each=12)

i <- i[1:(length(i)-6)]
i

# tapp again, now with our new indices to get yearly totals

# set the layer names
