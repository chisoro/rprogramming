# This first lab is about reading data from files and summarizing and combining the records
# this is very common and important step; but somewhat tricky to learn. Good luck!

# Before doing this exercise, you should have worked through 
# our Introduction to R: http://rspatial.org/intr/
 
# There is a file "Operating-Health-Facilities-with-location-2014.csv" under "data\tza"
# read the data in the file into a data.frame and answer all the questions
# by using R code only

# 1. read the data into a data.frame
setwd("C:/gdrive/arusha/data/tza")
d <- read.csv("Operating-Health-Facilities-with-location-2014.csv")

# 2. how many rows and columns are there?
dim(d)
nrow(d)
ncol(d)

# 3. what are the variable names?
colnames(d)

# 4. What is the number of facilities for each zone?
table(d$ZONE) 


# 5. Which region has most facilities (and how many), and which has least (and how many)?

x <- table(d$REGION)
names(which.min(x))
# names(x)[which.min(x)]
min(x)

names(which.max(x))
max(x)

# 6. What is the average elevation of all clinics?

mean(d$ALTITUDE, na.rm=TRUE)


# 7. Create a data.frame with four columns: ZONE, REGION, the number of facilities, and their average elevation (by REGION)

# we want something like this

#     ZONE        REGION elevation   n
#1 Central        Dodoma    1059.4 369
#2 Central       Singida    1355.4 210
#3 Eastern Dar es Salaam      54.4 599
# etc

# This is difficult. I would suggest using the aggregate function. 
# If you struggle divide and conquer. Do what you can do first. 
# Split the task into parts, and then combine them again later.

# one approach
a1 <- aggregate(d$ALTITUDE, d[, c('ZONE', 'REGION')], FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE) 
a2 <- aggregate(d$ALTITUDE, d[, c('ZONE', 'REGION')], FUN=length)
a <- merge(a1, a2, by=1:2)
 
# another approach
a <- aggregate(d$ALTITUDE, d[, c('ZONE', 'REGION')], FUN=function(x) c(mean(x, na.rm=TRUE), length(x))) 
a <- data.frame(a[,1:2], a[,3])

# 7b. provide appropriate column names 
colnames(a)[3:4] <- c('elevation', 'n')

# 7c. sort by ZONE, REGION
a <- a[order(a$ZONE, a$REGION), ]

# 7d. elevation should be rounded to the nearest 10 cm
a$elevation <- round(a$elevation, 1)

# 7e. show the first five lines of the data.frame
head(a, 5)
a[1:5, ]

# 7f. Save the file to disk (comma separated by values format)
write.csv(a, 'c:/temp/test.csv', row.names=FALSE)



# 8. Also read fdile "Tanzania-All-Waterpoints-July-2015.csv"
w <- read.csv("Tanzania-All-Waterpoints-July-2015.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# 9. For each region, compute the total number of water points, and the total number of people served (POPULATION.SERVED), 
# and the most common quantity ("WATER_QUAN") and type ("WATERPOINT") (either use the "modal" function from the raster package; or 
# use the table function


wa <- aggregate(w[, 'POPULATION.SERVED'], w[, 'REGION', drop=FALSE], length) 
colnames(wa)[2] <- 'nwp'
wb <- aggregate(w[, 'POPULATION.SERVED', drop=FALSE], w[, 'REGION', drop=FALSE], sum, na.rm=TRUE) 

library(raster)
wc <- aggregate(w[, c('WATER_QUAN', 'WATERPOINT')], w[, 'REGION', drop=FALSE], modal, na.rm=TRUE) 
# or
f <- function(x) names(which.max(table(x)))
wc <- aggregate(w[, c('WATER_QUAN', 'WATERPOINT')], w[, 'REGION', drop=FALSE], f) 

#combine:
water <- merge(wa, wb, by='REGION')
water <- merge(water, wc, by='REGION')


# 10. Make a table that shows counts of water quality types ("WATER_QUAL") by region
qual <- table(w$REGION, w$WATER_QUAL)

# 11. Make a new data.frame that combines the REGION level totals/averages for the  Health facilities and for the water points, and for the water quality
# to get something like:

#  REGION               ZONE elevation   n  nwp POPULATION.SERVED   WATER_QUAN         WATERPOINT coloured fluoride fluoride abandoned good milky salty salty abandoned soft unknown
