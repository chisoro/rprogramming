# We are going to extract annual average rainfall in Tanzania 
# for all years (that we have data for) of Tanzania 
# We are using a raster data that covers Tanzania and more and has monthly data 

# Later on we will use these data to see if variation in rainfall predicts
# variation in maize yield.

# You do not have to fill in very much. But take your time to see
# what is going on

# where is the monthly precipitation data ?
path <- "___________/climate/prec"

# get a vector of all the relevant files
ff <- list.files(___________, pattern='.tif$', full.names=___________)

# we want them in order. In this case, sort works (not always!)
ff <- sort(ff)

# make a SpatRaster 

s <- _____

# you should have 408 layers
s

# let's plot
plot(s)
# (by default, only the first 16 are plotted)

# plot the first three:

___________


# let's look at the mean for each month
# we use the stackApply function. We tell it to make 12 layers (by combining the 1st, with the 13th, 25th, etc. layer --- recycling at work).
rainmonth <- tapp(s, 1:12, mean)
# set the right names
names(rainmonth) <- month.name

# or in one step
#rainmonth <- tapp(s, 1:12, mean, wopt=list(names=month.name))

rainmonth
plot(rainmonth)

# compute the annual average total rainfall
rain <- sum(___________)
plot(rain)


# and the monthly mean precipitation averaged over all cells
mrain <- global(rainmonth, mean)
barplot(mrain) 

# we want to compare annual maize yield with annual rainfall. 
# the Tanzania dry season is in the middle of the year
# it may be better to have "rain-years" that start in July and run through June
# that is a bit tricky

# we make explicit indices to group months
# 34 years, 12 months
i <- rep(1:34, each=12)
i[1:36]
# but the first 6 months are the last 6 months of the previous rain-year
i <- c(rep(1,6), i+1)
i[1:36]
# and now we need to remove the last 6 months 
i <- i[1:(length(i)-6)]
i

# stackApply again, now with our new indices to get yearly totals
ss <- tapp(s, i, sum)
# set the layer names
names(ss) <- 1980:2014
# the first and the last year are incomplete 
ss <- ss[[ -c(1, nlyr(ss)) ]]

plot(ss)


# We only want Tanzania
# get the extent of Tanzania

# save to file
